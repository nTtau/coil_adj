#Code to iterate through changing coil radii -> modify currrent until target B centre field hit, calculate hoop stress 
#Output number of coils/spacing between coils, coil radius,coil current,Bcentre,coil dr/dz and hoop stress as csv -> maybe do average,min,max hoop stress?

# Use csv for NN training/M.O.O
# Train simple neural network? -> Then do M.O.O to optimise for min hoop stress and cost 
# Could we also add some sort of field uniformity measure? then make that another to optimise 
# Higher weighting to field uniformity -> higher weighting to physics considerations? 
# Higher weighting to min hoop stress -> higher weighting to engineering considerations? 
# Higher weighting to min cost -> higher weighting to cost considerations 


#Would be valid for any solenoid set up? would have to assume evenly spaced coils  
#Run each coil as a seperate process? for 16 coils use 16 threads?
